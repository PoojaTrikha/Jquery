     To load a hosted library, copy and paste the HTML snippet for that library (shown below) in your web page. For
    instance, to load jQuery, embed thesnippet in your web page.
    We recommend that you load libraries from the CDN via HTTPS, even if your own website only uses HTTP. Nowadays,
    performance is fast, and caching works just the same. The CDN's files are served with CORS and Timing-Allow headers and
    allowed to be cached for 1 year.
